Q1: 

Q2: OK, let's test this out. The transcript should be working properly.

Q3: And even if I switch to another one, it should still work.

Q4: OK, this is just me talking for another like 30 seconds to test the transcript to see if it's working properly right now. I hope it is.

Q5: I skipped to another question even though the transcript is still running to see if it breaks or not, but apparently it's not, so it's a great news. All right, this is my last question. I'm gonna finish this real quick in about 5 more seconds to get some more words in to test if this actually works or not. It seems like it is, and I'm happy with my results.
